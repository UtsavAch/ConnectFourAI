# ConnectFourAI

I made a ConnectFour game in which a player can play with the AI opponent. Additionally, you can visualize the play between two AI opponents. The applied algorithms are Minimax, MCTS, and A\* in Python. The frontend/game interface is implemented using JavaScript with HTML. The backend AI algorithms are connected to the frontend interface using the Python Flask library.

## Features
